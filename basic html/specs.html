            LIST OF PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Lab Reservation System
        </h2>
        <p>The following describes the features of a computer laboratory slot (seat) reservation web
        application. Groups must include at least three computer labs in the system. The
        minimum features required to be implemented for this project is as follows:</p>

        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>View Slot Availability
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A user may choose a computer lab and see the current available seats of
                the chosen lab. The user may opt to see the availability of the lab at other
                times for the next 7 days. A user must be a student user to reserve a seat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: Users may see who reserved a seat, as long as the reservee did not
                make the reservation anonymously. Clicking on a user’s name should link
                to that user’s profile. Availability must also update periodically so that the
                user does not need to refresh every time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" checked>Register
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A visitor must register if they want to reserve a lab slot. Here, a visitor
                must enter their DLSU email and a password. There should be 2 kinds of
                accounts, the student who can reserve lab slots, and the lab technician
                that can block a time slot for walk-in students.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Login
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                After registering properly, a visitor may log-in. Upon logging in, the option
                to reserve a slot will be open. The user is given the option to be
                “remembered” by the website. When the user chooses this option, every
                log in and visit to the website will extend their “remember” period by 3
                weeks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Logout
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The user may log out from their account. This should cut short the
                “remember” period if it exists, and clears any session-related data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Reserve
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Students can reserve slots that have not yet been taken. Lab slots are in
                intervals of 30 minutes. The student also has the option whether to reserve
                anonymously or not. The student can reserve more than one slot, and all
                the lab slots will be made under one reservation. A student may not reserve
                a previously reserved slot.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Reserve for a student
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lab technicians can make a reservation for walk-in students.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Remove reservation
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lab technicians have the ability to remove reservations of students who
                do not show up within 10 minutes of the reservation. This facility is only
                available 10 minutes of the actual reservation time. This will cancel the
                whole reservation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Edit reservation
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A student can edit reservations they previously made. Lab technicians are
                able to edit any reservations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>See reservations
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A user may check their reservations. They can see details such as the seat
                number, the laboratory, the date and time of request, and the date and
                time of reservation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>View / Edit User profile
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Registered users may edit their own profile, which includes a profile
                picture and description. Additionally, the profile should also list the
                student’s current reservations. Users may also view another user’s public
                profile, but they are not able to edit it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Delete User Account
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Students have the option to delete their own user, ultimately deleting their
                account and cancelling any pending reservations they may have.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>Search for users / free slots
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users can view all the available slots given a provided date and time, and
                the lab.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <input type="checkbox" unchecked>General
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Good user experience. Visitors can easily navigate without help, all
                information is easy to access. Good visual design. Design suits the theme
                of the application, and is cohesive and consistent across the whole
                application
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Note that for every instance of a create feature that adds data in the
        database of the web application, there should be corresponding features that will allow
        the corresponding user to read, update, and delete the data from the database. For
        example, if you have a feature that allows the user to create a post, the user should
        also be allowed to read/view the post, update/edit the post, and delete/remove the
        post.
        </p>
